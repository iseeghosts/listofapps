# List of 3rd party open source apps that are way much better than native windows apps

## 1. VLC media player in comparision to Windows Video or music app
Hosted at Gitlab, vlc was and still is one of those apps listed as priority for a new PC, and I am not talking about Store version of it.

## 2. 7zip compared to Windows native zip extractor
While Windows native file explorer is very much usedc in extracting zip files, it severely lacks many fetaures, 7zip can be used and is used to extract .exe files and extract icons (at least by me), you can also navigate through files and folder using its inbuild file manager. You can zip files with several different parameteres and in different formats. 7zip is hosted at sourcecode as an archive.

## 3. Files - Preview
While it's not exactly stable yet, but in terms of functionality and features, this app is rapidly gaining traction and far better than Windows native file explorer in terms of looks and somewhat behind in terms of function. This app is installable from both Windows (or "Microsoft") Store, or it's hosted repo on github

## Quickpad or Notepads
Windows Notepad app has been there since Windows xp (or maybe even older than that), and the updates it gets are far from even minor improvements so the users built there own, while these app aren't traditional looking app, there are fast, with still some issues to resolve, I am certain that they'll outcast the native app once ready. Both are hosted on github or Store.
